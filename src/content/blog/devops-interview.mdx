Automated rollback ensures that, in the event of a deployment failure, the system can automatically revert to the previous version, minimizing downtime and impact on users.
Q21. How does DevOps contribute to scalability and resource optimization?
DevOps practices, such as automation and containerization, enable organizations to scale resources efficiently, adapting to varying workloads while optimizing costs.

Q22. Explain the term "Chaos Engineering" in the context of DevOps.
Chaos Engineering involves intentionally introducing failures into a system to observe how it responds. This helps identify weaknesses and improve overall system resilience.
Q23. What is the role of a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) in DevOps?
A CMDB stores information about configuration items, facilitating efficient management and tracking of changes in the IT environment.
Q24. How does DevOps foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement?
DevOps encourages a culture of continuous feedback, learning from failures, and iteratively improving processes, leading to enhanced productivity and innovation.

Q25. Explain the concept of "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC) in simple terms.
IaC is like using a recipe to cook – you define how your infrastructure should look in code, and tools use this code to automatically set up and manage your servers and resources.
Q26. How do you ensure security in a containerized environment in a DevOps setup?
Security in a containerized environment involves scanning container images for vulnerabilities, restricting permissions, and implementing best practices for secure container deployment.
Q27. What are the key principles of DevOps that teams should follow?
Key principles include collaboration, automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and a culture of shared responsibility between development and operations teams.
      

Q28. How does DevOps contribute to achieving a faster time-to-market for software products?
DevOps automates processes, reduces manual interventions and promotes collaboration, enabling faster development, testing and deployment cycles, leading to a quicker time-to-market.
Q29. What is the role of a Version Control System (VCS) in a DevOps environment?
